This project is meant to explore the applicability of transfer learning using CRNN architecture pretrained on a clean, well labeled dataset and apply transfer learning for better accuracy on datasets containing messy real-world images, where text examples are extremely inconsistent in size, shape, and font. Our choice of datasets are [MJSynth](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/text/) and [TextOCR](https://textvqa.org/textocr/).
